# Experiment-Video
This project is an experimental presentation about the paper named *Finite-time Complementary Filter-based Attitude Control of Unmanned Aerial Vehicles with Gyro Bias*. The experiment video is in the *Experiment_result* folder. 

*  The folder *Experimental_platform* is primarily an introduction to the experimental foundation. There are three PDF files *Control diagram*, *Framework*, and *PLATFORM_CHINESE* in this folder. The *Control diagram*  mainly introduces the framework of the control part of the paper. The *Framework* mainly introduces the working architecture of the sensors and platforms used for the experiments. The *PLATFORM_CHINESE* is the product introduction of the experimental platform.

*  The folder *IMU_Datasheet* includes the datasheets for the two attitude sensors used in the experiments.

*  There is a txt file in *Experiment_result* which mainly notes on some of the acronyms in the experimental video.

*  _Notes.1_：    
   Scheme 1:  Asymptotically controller with finite-time complementary filter (FTCF-ASC);   
   Scheme 2:  Finite-time controller based on adding a power integrator technique with finite-time complementary filter (FTCF-PFC);    
   Scheme 3:  Finite-time controller with finite-time complementary filter (FTCF-FTC);  
   Scheme 4:  Asymptotically controller  with asymptotically complementary filter (ASF-ASC);  
   Scheme 5:  Finite-time controller based on adding a power integrator technique with asymptotically complementary filter (ASF-PFC);  
   Scheme 6:  Finite-time controller  with asymptotically complementary filter (ASF-FTC);  
   MADE：maximum attitude deviation error；  
   AEA： average attitude control accuracy.

*    _Notes.2_:  
  The first half of the video documents the operation of the experimental platform, and the second half shows the response curves of the experiments.
